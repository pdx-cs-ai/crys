# crys: Cryptarithm Solver
CS 441/541 Fall 2020 class

This program solves cryptarithms using a simple depth-first
search. There are two implementations: Python and Rust.

This is not fast code:

* No unit propagations
* Rechecks all completed work at each step
* Uses no backjumping or forward-pruning

Thanks to Adam Craig for the nice name.
